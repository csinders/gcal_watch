gcal_watch
==========

a light up wearable/lamp thing using python and my google calendar data 

we used an arduino uno with a single LED to light up whenever a google calendar event was occuring. 
it's coded in python, as well. 
i saved everytihng in my arduino files, since the output is an arduino. but feel free to not do that//do whatever you want, cos you can download it and change it, yay! 

things you will need to do:
Python uses the API from here
